## Hi, I'm Ayomide Adegoke

Iâ€™m into Machine Learning and Robotics. I love building value by designing and deploying AI-powered systems.  
My work spans *NLP and computer vision*, with hands-on experience in building *end-to-end ML pipelines* from data preprocessing to model deployment.  

I'm currently learning and interested in:
- *Deep learning and large language models (LLMs)*  
- *Fine-tuning transformers for domain-specific tasks*  
- *Full-stack ML applications* that bridge AI research with practical, user-ready solutions

  I'm actively looking for collaborations
